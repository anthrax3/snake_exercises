Snakes Game
Exercise 6 - Classes

Goal: Refactor the snakes game using classes.

Description: In this exercise, we will reorganize the implementation
into classes, so that it is object oriented.

Instructions:
  1) Open GameRunner.java. Find the line:
       gameFrame.add(new GameExercises());
     and change it to:
       gameFrame.add(new GameObjectExercises());
  2) Try running the project. It should run successfully, and
     you should see a blank canvas.
  3) Open GameObjectExercises.java. Instantiate a snake
     and an apple in the constructor.
       - What do you think the initial positions would be?
  4) Modify the redrawCanvas method so that it draws the snake
     and the apple. Refer to your previous implementation. You
     will also need to add code to the Snake and Apple class.
  5) Modify the onKeyPress so that you can control the snake.
  6) Add back the collision and apple detection.
