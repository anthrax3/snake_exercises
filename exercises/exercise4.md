## Exercise 4 - Loops

**Goal**: Practice using loops.

**Description**: In this exercise, we will refactor our code to use loops,
so that we can change the length of the snake.

### Instructions

1. Open `GameExercises.java` file
2. Refactor the snake drawing code to use a loop instead of manually
   drawing the snake.
3. Try changing the length of the snake to 8.
4. Refactor the `moveUp` code to use a for loop.
